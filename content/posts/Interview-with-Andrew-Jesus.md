# Interview with Mechanical Engineering Student Andrew Jesus

Recently, we had the opportunity to sit down with Andrew Jesus, a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Andrew shared his thoughts on a variety of topics related to his field of study, including his experiences in the classroom and his plans for the future.

## Andrew's Background

Andrew grew up in San Francisco, California, and developed an interest in engineering at a young age. His father, a civil engineer, often took him to construction sites and talked to him about the different projects he was working on. Andrew was fascinated by the process of designing and building structures, and knew from a young age that he wanted to pursue a career in engineering.

## Andrew's Experience in Mechanical Engineering

Andrew is currently a junior at UCLA, studying mechanical engineering. He shared that he has been interested in mechanical engineering since he took his first physics class in high school. According to Andrew, "I loved learning about how things work, and I was fascinated by the way that mechanical engineers are able to design and build complex machines and systems."

Andrew has taken a variety of courses in his major, including mechanics of materials, thermodynamics, and dynamics. He shared that he has found these courses challenging but rewarding. "It's not easy, but I enjoy the challenge of figuring out complex problems and coming up with creative solutions," he said.

## Andrew's Plans for the Future

When asked about his plans for the future, Andrew shared that he is considering pursuing a career in the aerospace industry. He has always been interested in space exploration, and he believes that working on spacecraft and other aerospace projects would be both challenging and fulfilling.

Andrew also shared that he is interested in pursuing a graduate degree in mechanical engineering. "I want to continue learning and exploring new areas within the field," he said. "I think a graduate degree will allow me to do that."

## Conclusion
