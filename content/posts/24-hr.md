# Why the 24-hour system is better than the 12-hour system

When it comes to telling time, there are two commonly used systems: the 12-hour system and the 24-hour system. While the 12-hour system is widely used in the United States, the 24-hour system is used in most other parts of the world. In this blog post, we'll discuss why the 24-hour system is better than the 12-hour system.

## Clarity and precision

One of the main advantages of the 24-hour system is its clarity and precision. With a 24-hour system, there's no confusion about whether it's morning or afternoon, as there is with the 12-hour system. For example, if someone says "2:00," it's unclear whether they mean 2:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the afternoon. However, if someone says "14:00" in the 24-hour system, there's no confusion. It's clear that they mean 2:00 in the afternoon.

## International communication

Another advantage of the 24-hour system is that it's used internationally. If you're communicating with someone in a different country, using the 24-hour system ensures that there's no confusion about the time. For example, if you're in the United States and you're scheduling a meeting with someone in Europe, using the 24-hour system ensures that you're both on the same page about the time of the meeting.

## Standardization

The 24-hour system is also more standardized than the 12-hour system. In the 12-hour system, there are different conventions for writing times with "am" and "pm" or using a "military time" notation. In the 24-hour system, there's only one way to write a time, which eliminates confusion and errors.
